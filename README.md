This is a personal website to be added to professional media such as LinkedIn.

I am in my last semester of college for Cybersecurity and wanted to start building up a portfolio.

This website is a work in progress as I experiment with things within the web environment.

I am not a web developer so this is nowhere near a perfect website.
